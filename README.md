# WK AI

AI assistant for **passive component testing**, aligned with [Wayne Kerr](https://www.waynekerr.com/) precision LCR and impedance instruments.

- **Identify DUT**: Upload a photo of a component (inductor, capacitor, resistor) → suggested type, working range, and LCR test setup.
- **Interpret Sweep Graph**: Upload a frequency-sweep screenshot → curve interpretation, key features, recommended band, and next tests.

UI + mock only; replace mock with Vision API when ready.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (includes npm) — [Download LTS](https://nodejs.org) if you don’t have it.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
